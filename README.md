# Minecraft Server Status Discord Bot
Give your players a way to see if your Minecraft server are online using /ping

### IMPORTANT NOTE!
This is where I develop the bot, a lot of stuff may not work and are constantly changing. If you find any problems then please tell me!
To find a stable version then go to the [Master Branch](https://github.com/TheCactusMonkey/MinecraftServer-DiscordBot/tree/master).

Thanks :D
